<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An Answer to a problem</h2>
<p>The EU FP7 Projects EUROFLEETS(1) and EUROFLEETS2 are a European wide alliance of marine research centres that aims to develop a new pan-European distributed infrastructure with common strategic vision and coordinated access to Research Vessels (RVs) and marine equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within this context <strong>logging of information on how, when and where anything happens on board the vessel is crucial information for data users</strong> in a later stage. This forms a primordial step in the process of data quality control as it could assist in the understanding of anomalies and unexpected trends recorded in the acquired data sets. In this way completeness of the metadata is improved as it is recorded accurately at the origin of the measurement. The collection of this crucial information is done in very different ways, using different procedures, formats and pieces of software in the context of the European Research Fleets, what makes difficult the task of users who want and need to log general purpose information and events on-board when they access to a platform different from their own country, loosing the opportunity to produce this valuable metadata on-board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the many goals the EUROFLEETS projects have, a very important task is the development of an <strong>"event log software"</strong> called EARS (Eurofleets Automatic Reporting System) that enables scientists and operators to record what happens during a survey. <strong>EARS will allow users to fill, in a standardized way, the gap existing at the moment in metadata description that only very seldom links data with its history</strong>. Events generated automatically by acquisition instruments will also be handled, enhancing the granularity and precision of the event annotation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The adoption of a common procedure to log survey events and a common terminology to describe them is crucial to provide a friendly and successfully metadata on-board creation procedure for the European Research Fleets. The possibility of automatically reporting metadata and general purpose data, <strong>will simplify the work of scientists and data managers with regards to data transmission</strong>.
An improved accuracy and completeness of metadata is expected when events are recorded at acquisition time. This will also enhance multiple usage of the data as it allows verification of the different requirements existing in different disciplines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Concept and Basics on EurofleetsAutomaticReportingSystem (EARS)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The underlying idea of <strong>EARS</strong> is that, during a survey, all <strong>underway data</strong> and <strong>occurring events</strong> should be recorded in a database so that later, relevant information can be gathered semantically upon domain specific criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of <strong>underway data</strong> various kinds of sensors with different wiring standards are bridged to a private Ethernet network where a software can isolate datagrams and parse them. Most of the incoming datagrams are very likely to be in the NMEA format, but the system can handle any kind of format thanks to a datagram parser editor, that allows to customize the software for practically any kind of set-up.</li>
</ul>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>occurring events</strong> during a scientific cruise can be anything from instrumental anomalies, to observations not recorded by a dedicated sensor. Also the collection of any type of material, a &lsquo;sample', prior to analysis is considered as an event. Events cover a wide range of domains, they generally refer to a human input and in this sense a specific Graphic User interface was developed but also can be generated by any means of automatic system detecting any interesting fact of interest to be logged.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows graphically the concept of an event, and the special semantic conception of it adopted in EARS.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img src="{$clientServletPath}/?newsId=475&amp;fileName=Figure1.png" alt="" width="500" /></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technicians and scientists in different disciplines are the potential users of the tool but also crew members can be also responsible to generate common purpose events related to the navigation as the departure or arrival to a specific site. Logging of information on how, when and where an event happens on board of the vessel is crucial information for data users in a later stage.</p>
<p>It can be said that <strong>EARS</strong> is seated on top of the adoption of three basics: a common event logging procedure, the adoption of standards, formats and semantics, and a set of event access and retrieval procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The common event logging procedure</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the event recording procedure, EARS has been developed two different strategies:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<p>-&nbsp;For recording those data having interest by the fact to provide the boundary conditions for the rest of the observations (like navigation, weather data, sea water basic properties) or are commonly recorded by means of unattended (no human interaction) systems, EARS provides a logging system based on broadcasting these diverse data in form of NMEA sentences and storing them in a relational database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;For recording events triggered by an human interaction (any observation or annotation than any scientist or system operator wants to have recorded), EARS provides a Graphical User Interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standards formats and semantics</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is easy to understand how important it is that the meaning of information is clear across, but even within domains. EARS approach is to formalize meaning using shared resources such as controlled vocabularies that can be linked to/from/within the information itself. This way, information carries its definition.</p>
<p>This approach was followed throughout all aspects of the development of EARS. Underway data and events are always linked to external <strong>controlled vocabularies</strong>. At the same time new terms can be created and made available to the whole community. An <strong>ontology</strong> is developed allowing the storage of pre-defined relations between these terms. Querying this ontology, presents users a configuration for their scientific cruise. A common approach for storing events, using common terms, facilitates cross-domain data discovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event access</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all information is collected in the database, this can be retrieved on board with the same tool that it has been used to ingest manual events. Accessing the event log from outside the vessel could be also of interest for many purposes. The production of event summaries could be done in many ways, from automatically compiled or by demand.</p>
<p>A part of the event summary can be offered to the user in a friendly human readable format, EARS has adopted a standardized way to provide this  information to ensure interoperability with other information systems (other EUROFLEETS services or Data Centre services). Thus each EARS platform exposes the event summary by using a specific language from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) called SensorML that allows to produce fine description of any observation procedure, sensor or instrument, as well its history of events associated.</p>
<p>A set of Web Service specific interfaces are prepared in order to get from the vessels different information including the last 24h event registry. For example a <strong>Ship Summary Report</strong> (SSR) is available that gathers the most important information of the last 24 hours, or the vessel track. This is not only accessed directly by end users, but also by the <a href="http://eurofleet.maris2.nl/dvtes/prototype.asp" target="_blank">EUROFLEETS <strong>EVIOR portal</strong></a>&nbsp; . This is a service that adds further value providing a number of infobases among which a prototype service for following research vessels and their underway activities based on the EARS web services access. EVIOR retrieves and harmonizes information acquired from multiple vessels at the same time and therefore allows to easily have a snapshot of their activities.</p>

<p class="label_rv" style="background-color:#069FF8" align="center"><font size="4">EARS IN DETAIL</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EARS V1 is composed by a set of software pieces designed and developed during EUROFLEETS(1) project but also uses existing elements that has been designed and used by its partners and instrumentation that are commonly present on board. The main elements that compose EARS V1 are shown in Figure 2, where the arrows show the flow of information.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<img src="{$clientServletPath}/?newsId=475&amp;fileName=Figure2.jpg" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NMEA INSTRUMENTS AND GPS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A NMEA GPS is the basic instrumentation that needs EARS to work, as it provides the information about the location where any event is generated. Additionally EARS can work with any unattended instrument that is able to generate information using the NMEA183 standard in order to provide the set of general purpose information commonly referred as "underway data". Underway data is complimentary used to better understand the boundary conditions where the main data acquisition activity occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SERIAL TO ETHERNET CONVERTERS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;EARS system is designed to work with data and services using Internet Protocols running on the vessel's Ethernet Local Area Network. For that reason EARS uses specific devices (commercial) to convert NMEA Rs232 messages produced by GPS and Instruments to TCP/UDP datagrams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CASINO+ and CASINO+DB</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casino+ systems is an Ifremer piece of software designed to store the events and the information that come (UDP datagrams) from instruments. The Casino+DB is the MySQL Relational Database that EARS V1 uses to store all the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONFIGURATION GUI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Configuration GUI is a piece of software specifically designed in EARS to configure CASINO+ system to work in EARS environment. The GUI facilitates the ingestion of new NMEA instruments and facilitates the usage of the system for a non experts users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EVENTS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Events are the key piece of information managed in EARS and they are designed as a combination of a set of elements (subject, actor, tool, action, properties) that are under a relational controlled vocabulary. This means that for creating an event to describe "any fact that happens during a survey and has a potential interest to be logged" it is necessary to use specific terms combined and ordered in a specific way. This manner to use controlled vocabularies EARS consolidate the way on how and event should be created and increase the interoperability of the final metadata. As the potential combination of terms are quite large, in EARS V1 the vocabulary is organized as we call "personal or vessel trees" that are the most commonly used terms used in a specific acquisition scenario (geophysics, oceanography, fisheries, etc.) or vessel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next figure shows at (left side) an example of this vocabulary personalization in form of "personal tree", in this case showing the potential terms and their relations ready to be used for a specific "mission" (survey) to build up Events (right side).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="{$clientServletPath}/?newsId=475&amp;fileName=GUI_EARS_MUMM.png" alt="" width="500" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MANUAL EVENT ENTRY GUI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This GUI allows a user to create time tagged events that describe any possible fact related with the navigation of the vessel, the operation of a specific instrument or observation, or with the course of the survey.
The GUI also allows the user to set up the primary information of the survey (name and acronyms, chief scientist, ...) and modify and retrieve the event log already entered into the system.</p>
<p>An advanced usage of the Manual Event Entry GUI is to set up the personal or vessel tree (the set of terms that the user will use to build up an Event).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHIP SUMMARY REPORT ENGINE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unattended piece of software produces the named "SSR" files. This XML file contents basic information about the vessel (name, last navigation info), the cruise that is being celebrating on board, and also the last 24 hours of data about navigation in GML format and the last event report in SensorML format.</p>
<p>SSR files are populated to shore where satellite communications are available, providing to the vessel's operator site and to the <a href="http://www.seadatanet.org/" target="_blank">SeaDataNet site</a>&nbsp;through the <a href="http://eurofleet.maris2.nl/dvtes/prototype.asp" target="_blank">EVIOR portal</a> updated information of the current cruise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="label_rv" style="background-color:#069FF8" align="center"><font size="4">Next steps (EARS V2)</font></p>
<p>EARS V1 will be presented "in society" during a specific EUROFLEETS2 1st User Workshop to be celebrated 21st-22nd October 2015 in Ostend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the planned tasks for EUROFLEETS2, the EARS system is still in evolution concerning its basement architecture. Despite the user experience will remain more or less intact with a few improvements in the look and feel of the main GUI's (pending on the user feedback during the first user workshop), EARS V2 will have a new architecture based fundamentally in two main pillars:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">
<p>1-	Use of a more sophisticated vocabulary engine. A complete ontology system (hidden to the user) will provide EARS with a more powerful vocabulary management mechanism to build up and maintain "vocabulary trees".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2-	Use of a Web Service Layer to integrate the different EARS elements. On top of a formal specification (<a href="https://share.ifremer.fr/share/page/site/eurofleets2/document-details?nodeRef=workspace://SpacesStore/c1bab29d-a04a-47fe-8947-fab4139dd904" target="_blank">Eurofleets Web Service White Book</a>), a set of Web services has been implemented as a way to integrate all of EARS elements (GUIs, Data Acquisition modules, Data Bases and SSR engine). This element, also transparent to the user, will facilitate the implementation of the system in a very high variety of vessel system information infrastructures facilitating the "EARS " implantation in the European Research Fleets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During 2016 is planned to celebrate the second edition of EARS User Workshop, where these new features will be present in the system.</p>
